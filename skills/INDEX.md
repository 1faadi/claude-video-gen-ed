# OpenMontage — Skill Index

> For the full agent onboarding guide, see [`AGENT_GUIDE.md`](../AGENT_GUIDE.md) in the project root.

This file lists all available Layer 2 skills and documents the 3-layer knowledge architecture.

## How skills are organised

Three layers: `tools/` (what exists, queried via the registry), `skills/` (this
directory: how OpenMontage uses it), `.agents/skills/` (vendor knowledge, reached
through each tool's `agent_skills[]`). Full description: `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
and `docs/agent-guide/layers.md`. Tool discovery is always the registry
(`registry.capability_catalog()`), never a hardcoded list.
