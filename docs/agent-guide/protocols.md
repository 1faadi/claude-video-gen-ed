# Communication Protocol, Style Playbooks

## Communication Protocol

Agents coordinate through canonical JSON artifacts, checkpoints, pipeline manifests, and the tool registry.

Primary files:

- Artifact schemas: `schemas/artifacts/`
- Checkpoint schema: `schemas/checkpoints/checkpoint.schema.json`
- Pipeline manifest schema: `schemas/pipelines/pipeline_manifest.schema.json`
- Pipeline manifests: `pipeline_defs/`
- Style playbooks: `styles/*.yaml` (validated by `schemas/styles/playbook.schema.json`)
- Tool contract: `tools/base_tool.py`
- Tool registry: `tools/tool_registry.py`
- Stage director skills: `skills/pipelines/<pipeline>/<stage>-director.md`
- Meta skills: `skills/meta/*.md`

Checkpoint rules:

- Checkpoints live at `projects/<project_id>/checkpoint_<stage>.json` (the project workspace — this is what the Backlot board watches).
- `status` may be `completed`, `failed`, `awaiting_human`, or `in_progress`.
- Write an `in_progress` checkpoint on entering each stage; during `assets`/`compose`, refresh `metadata.partial_progress` after each completed scene/asset unit — this powers live progress on the board.
- `completed` and `awaiting_human` checkpoints must include the canonical artifact.
- A gated stage (`human_approval_default: true`) can only be written `completed` with `human_approved=True` — the writer raises a GATE VIOLATION otherwise.
- Superseded checkpoints are archived automatically to `projects/<project_id>/history/` — stage re-runs never destroy run history.
- Invalid checkpoints or invalid canonical artifacts are contract violations and should fail fast.

Pipeline manifest rules:

- Pipelines are declarative YAML manifests in `pipeline_defs/`.
- Stages declare: `skill` (director skill path), `produces`, `tools_available`, `review_focus`, `success_criteria`, `human_approval_default`.
- Adding a new pipeline requires a manifest + stage director skills.

Tool rules:

- Every production tool must inherit from `BaseTool`.
- Tool discovery flows through the registry, not ad hoc imports.
- Support-envelope reporting is the source of truth for capability, status, and resource requirements.

## Style Playbooks

| Playbook | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| `clean-professional` | Corporate, educational, SaaS |
| `premium-minimalist` | Investor updates, expert explainers, product narratives |
| `flat-motion-graphics` | Social media, TikTok, startups |
| `minimalist-diagram` | Technical deep-dives, architecture |
| `ink-sketch` (Ink Theater) | Hand-drawn ink-on-white doodle animation; a character that draws itself, walks, dances; contraption explainers |

For custom, atelier, brand, launch, or hero work, read `skills/meta/taste-direction.md` before choosing a playbook. Carry its `taste_profile` into the proposal so later stages can preserve the design read, visual variance, motion intensity, information density, reference strategy, and anti-patterns.

### Hand-drawn "doodle" animation → Ink Theater / Ink Puppet

For any brief that wants a **hand-drawn ink doodle** look — "a sketch that comes to life", "a pencil / stick figure that walks or dances", "a little character that acts out the idea", whiteboard-doodle explainers — use the **Ink Theater** engine + **Ink Puppet** mocap system (`skills/creative/ink-theater.md`, `ink-theater/README.md`). It is a **style + reusable engine, not a new pipeline**: illustration / contraption pieces run on the `animation` pipeline; a mocap character (draws itself → walks / dances / waves via `InkPuppet.choreograph([...])`) runs on `character-animation`. Cross-tool entry points: **`/ink-art`** (create a vector doodle from scratch) and **`/animated-drawing`** (animate a *supplied* drawing with mocap — raster; `skills/creative/animated-drawing.md`). Never hand-tune character motion — the agent only chooses named mocap clips.
